## Description

This game is about slowly overwhelming the user with more and more tasks to do. It starts off with a single menial ball
to keep up, and slowly increases in difficulty as more tasks appear. There are four total: the solo-pong game, a
simple "cow" that the user has to click on, a math prompt, and a pattern prompt. The original goal was to get the game
to be very overwhelming by the end. I think the final result is only mildly so,but I still think its enjoyable.

NOTE: The reset button does not work properly :) If you want to play again, it's better to refresh the page.

This project uses [p5.js](https://p5js.org).

## Attribution

NOTE: I tried using an HTML textbox in my game and could not get it to overlap properly with my canvas (and I couldn't
find any sources online that did what I wanted), so I had chatGPT write a custom textbox in p5 which I then used as a
base. The function is marked.
