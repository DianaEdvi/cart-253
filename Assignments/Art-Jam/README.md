## Description

This project requires the player to repeatedly click on hearts using their "Gaymobile" (the cursor)
The hearts move or transform in different ways on the screen
Each click changes the heart's color in the order of the rainbow
The player wins if all the colors of the LGBTQ+ flag are visible (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple)
